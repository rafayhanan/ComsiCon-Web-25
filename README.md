# ComsiCon-Web-25

This is our attempt at building a full-fledged project management platform, during a caffeine-fueled 6-hour coding sprint for the ComsiCon hackathon.


### Features Tackled

In this whirlwind of development, we focused on building:

- User Management & Authentication: The ability to register on the platform and assume roles such as manager, team lead, member etc.
- Project & Workspace Management: The ability to create, update, and manage distinct project containers.
- Team Invitation System: Logic for inviting members and managing roles within a project.
- Task Lifecycle Management: A robust system for creating, assigning, and updating the status of tasksâ€”the engine for a future Kanban board.
- Chat: A chatroom that uses sockets to initiate communication between team members.
